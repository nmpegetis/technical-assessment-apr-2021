## Full Stack developer Assignment 

You have two full days to complete and return to us (via a github repo link we can access), fully functional and executable programs, (which we can pull and run ourselves), for each of the three exercises below.

Implement one web-based(TypeScript), one in Java-based, and one in the language of your choice(Java or TypeScript). 

1. **FizzBuzz**

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

2. **Design Pattern**

Select a non-trivial design pattern and implement a small demo application where using that design pattern is appropriate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)

3. **Rock, Paper, Scissors**

Implement a version of the game Rock-Paper-Scissors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors )
