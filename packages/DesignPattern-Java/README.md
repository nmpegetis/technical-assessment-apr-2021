## Design Patterns Assessment

#Implementations for the:
* Observer Pattern

For the Observer Design Pattern I created a simulation for the stock market indices. A Market observes the changes on each market index and automatically informs the registered subscribers about the changes. In the example implemented I have 3 different market indices and two 2 application subscribers supposing the first as a web app and the second as a mobile app.
