## Technical Assessment (Apr 2021)

This repository contains my implementations for a technical assessment I was assigned on the pursue for a new career as a Fullstack Software Engineer (see [here](https://github.com/nmpegetis/technical-assessment-apr-2021/blob/main/ASSESSMENT.md) the assignment).

The assessment contains 3 assignments:
1. A **FizzBuzz** implementation using Java or Typescript
2. A non-trivial **Design Patterns** implementation using Java or Typescript
3. A **Rock-Paper-Scissors** implementation using Java or Typescript

> The only restriction to the above is to use **Java** and **Typescript** at least once each, in all three implementations

#### Preparation

For this assessment I decided to use **monorepo** with [lerna.js](https://lerna.js.org/) as I wanted to have all the 3 assignments in one repo and also if needed have different deployment enviromnents for each assignment (comparing to having 3 different deployments from 3 different repositories).

Finally I needed to deploy in the given deadline only the **Rock-Paper-Scissor**. You can use the app here:

#### Implementation
All 3 implementations are under the [packages folder](https://github.com/nmpegetis/technical-assessment-apr-2021/tree/main/packages) in this repository.
In each of the 3 implementations I provide a seperate `README.md` file giving instructions on how to `build` and `run`.

### Enjoy! :)
